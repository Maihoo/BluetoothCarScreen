# BluetoothCarScreen

This is an Android App Prototype for Bluetooth Picture transmission between two Devices.

The porpuse of the App is to transfer Text or Images from a phone to a Tablet that sits in the backwindow of a car. 
PLEASE DO NOT USE THIS ON PUBLIC ROADS! I'm pretty sure it's illegal. At least here in germany.
